					<h2>Why Coding Bootcamp:</h2>

				<div class="my-info">
					<p> I was skeptical about going to a coding bootcamp to learn coding and expect to get a job without a degree. However,
                        the more research I did on google or switchup, the more I started to believe that bootcamps can actually 
                        make a difference in my skills. The research made me realize that the coding field is more about skills and 
                        application vs having a degree from a University. I realize bootcamps cannot get you a job. It's up to the person to do that.
                    </br></br>
                        However,the bootcamp will definetly teach you the skills you need to land those jobs if you are willing to put in the work.
                        Bootcamps aren't cheap and not all bootcamps are created equally based on my research. Eventually, I ended up choosing FlatIron 
                        School as my top boot camp. The main reason I chose this as my top bootcamp is due to the skills you learn throughout the course
                        as well as the staff. I like the fact that the curriculum teaches you two different languages in Ruby and Javascript as well as having
                        multiple projects you can show in your portfolio once you're done with the bootcamp. Also, based on the reviews I read online, the staff 
                        genuinely cares about your well being and do everything in their power to get you through the course as well as helping you find a job
                        afterward. Many other bootcamps just try to churn out as many graudates as possible without actually worrying about the people themselves.
                        The fact that there is a money back guarentee as well speaks volumes about the confidence the bootcamp has in themselves to 
                        teach people the skills necessary to enter the CS field. 
                    </br></br>
                        Another large factor in my decision for this bootcamp is that there is an option 
                        to attend the bootcamp on campus in Chicago. If I invest such a large sum of money into a bootcamp, I want to be able to interact with people
                        that have the same passion and drive as I do. Based on my experience in college, I strongly believed that working with people with a similar goal and mindset
                        goes a long way in learning concepts as well motivating one another. If everyone is concentrated then the learning enviornment will be that much better and help
                        everyone through the bootcamp with the support of one another, something that I think would be lacking if I were to do a course online. Having interaction with another
                        person is something that is needed in order for yourself to realize your own shortcomings and improve upon them as well as helping out others at the same time.
                     </br></br>
                        The last reason I chose this bootcamp is the way the concepts are being taught. I 
                        took the free intro to Javascript prep course offered on the website, and was blown away by the learn platform. It was able to explain concepts
                        in simple terms and have a lab after each lesson to reinforce the concepts learned. The whole structure of the teaching was fantastic and helped me finish
                        the course within a couple days. I'd always favor in person teaching due to the convience of being to ask the instructor a question whenever I 
                        was confused, but the learn help chat was actually very responsive. I only used it a few times, but I always received a quick and concise response!
                     </br></br>
                        I realize that doing a coding is not a cure all solution, but I believe it is the best option for myself. Not only is it similar in price to me finishing a minor,
                        but it will teach me skills better suited in an actual job enviornment and can help me improve my skills and projects. Whereas I believe finishing the minor will teach 
                        me more about concepts such as algorithims, but will not help too much with my project and on hand skills. Most importantly, it will fill the void that I've felt for 
                        a while now. I can actually do something that I can say I am truly passionate about and have fun learning. I'm ready to go all in on this bootcamp and put in all my effort!
