					<p>Hello, I have recently turned 23 years old, 
                        and I am ready to make a large change in my life. I have enjoyed
                        using computers for as long as I can remember. Whether it be playing games on them
                        or just troubleshooting the ins and outs of how the machine operates. My first interaction
                        with computer science came in high school. I initially took a computer building class to learn
                        how to create computers from their seperate parts, but the teacher also taught some concepts about 
                        computer science towards the end of the curriculum and recommended we take the computer science course offered at our school.
                        The concepts he taught were interesting, and I decided to also take the computer science class my senior year. The way the concepts 
                        were introduced in the class was something I haden't encountered before. It was very logic based and 
                        was initially very hard to understand. This led to many hard and long nights working on projects for the class.
                        The projects are not something you can just do half heartedly and expect to work. You had to fully understand 
                        the logic behind the code you were writing or nothing would work. Although I hated working on these projects when I was confused,
                        the payoff more than made up for it. The amount of excitment I got when creating even a simple addition program was unreal. 
                        This was only the start of my love for coding.
                        
                    </p>
